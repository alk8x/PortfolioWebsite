                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
                    This project involves recreating former 3D wooden puzzle trinkets in SolidWorks and then 3D printing them.
                    I deeply enjoy these types of puzzles, and trying to recreate them without any dimensions or specifications, just a video, is a puzzle within itself.
