                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
                    The second and final year of the Master's in Design Engineering program consists of developing an indepedent, year-long project in any domain.
                    As the lead creator and designer of MathMosaic, a groundbreaking gamified learning platform, I spearheaded the development of an innovative solution to transform traditional mathematics education. 
                    My role encompassed conceptualizing and implementing a unique educational experience that leverages intrinsic motivation, contextual learning, and exploratory environments to address math anxiety and boost confidence among high school students, with a particular focus on empowering underrepresented groups in STEM. 
                    By integrating real-world puzzle scenarios within a narrative-driven framework, MathMosaic encourages students to uncover the relevance and beauty of mathematics in their daily lives, fostering a growth mindset and critical thinking skills essential for success in STEM fields.

                    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the US, traditional math education, detached from real-world relevance, contributes to widespread <span>math anxiety, affecting approximately 93% of adults</span> (1). 
                        This disconnection exacerbates engagement issues, particularly affecting underrepresented groups in STEM and leading to significant dropout rates in critical courses (2). 
                        The prevalence of math anxiety in children, with 25% experiencing moderate to high levels, highlights systemic educational flaws (6). Declining math scores, with <span>73% of 8th graders scoring at or below basic levels</span> in 2022, underscore the urgent need for pedagogical reform (7).
