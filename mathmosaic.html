                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
                    The second and final year of the Master's in Design Engineering program consists of developing an indepedent, year-long project in any domain.
                    As the lead creator and designer of MathMosaic, a groundbreaking gamified learning platform, I spearheaded the development of an innovative solution to transform traditional mathematics education. 
                    My role encompassed conceptualizing and implementing a unique educational experience that leverages intrinsic motivation, contextual learning, and exploratory environments to address math anxiety and boost confidence among high school students, with a particular focus on empowering underrepresented groups in STEM. 
                    By integrating real-world puzzle scenarios within a narrative-driven framework, MathMosaic encourages students to uncover the relevance and beauty of mathematics in their daily lives, fostering a growth mindset and critical thinking skills essential for success in STEM fields.

                    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the US, traditional math education, detached from real-world relevance, contributes to widespread <span>math anxiety, affecting approximately 93% of adults</span> (1). 
                        This disconnection exacerbates engagement issues, particularly affecting underrepresented groups in STEM and leading to significant dropout rates in critical courses (2). 
                        The prevalence of math anxiety in children, with 25% experiencing moderate to high levels, highlights systemic educational flaws (6). Declining math scores, with <span>73% of 8th graders scoring at or below basic levels</span> in 2022, underscore the urgent need for pedagogical reform (7).

                    <p>The Learning Pyramid is a well renowned model for best practices while teaching for students to retain the most information. In the US, it is common practice to teach mathematics purely by lecture, even though active learning methods have been proven to be more valuable.

                    <p>Past research studies have proven <span>2 out of 5</span> processors in our brain that light up from doing math are <span>visual</span>. "When we don’t ask students to think visually, we miss an incredible opportunity to increase students’ understanding and to enable important brain crossing."
                        <br><br>Furthermore, educational theories stress the importance of connecting math education to real-life scenarios to foster a deeper understanding and relevance of mathematics, moving away from superficial, procedural knowledge towards a more meaningful, conceptual grasp of math.

                        <span>Khan Academy</span> is a leading platform for understanding mathematical arithmetic. It provides video lessons and practice problems. It's widely used by students individually but also in classrooms. While it is great for quick understanding to pass a test or finish homework, it lacks content on conceptual understanding.<br>
                        <span>3Blue1Brown</span> is a popular YouTube channel that visually represents high level mathematical concepts such as derivatives and differential equations. Speaking with the founder, Grant Sanderson, he commented "online education straddles a line between entertainment and education...I think it will always be supplemental to in-person education, and more generally media where students are doing exercises and projects. You can only learn so much through passive viewership and reading.”

                        <br> <span>Consistent</span> - the design of the platform will be intuitive for users, while also repeating previously mastered concepts when introducing new ones.
                        <br> <span>Multimodal</span> - the platform will be highly interactive and visual, but also have features such as sound that are pivotal to the learning experience.
                        <br> <span>Engaging</span> - students will feel immersed in the platform when interacting, and want to use it as they continue their math education.
