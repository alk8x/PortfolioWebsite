                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>In Spring 2023, as part of my Master’s in Design Engineering at Harvard, I contributed to the creation of the BASE Water Sensor project, an initiative addressing water contamination from the textile industry. 
                    As a Mechanical Engineer and Storyteller, I led the design and narrative of DripTracker, one of three products we developed to provide real-time water quality data. 
                    My role involved utilizing CAD for product design, engaging in iterative development, and enhancing user experience through storytelling. 
                    This project demonstrated my capability to merge technical engineering with public engagement, culminating in solutions that are not only innovative but also respectful of environmental and public health concerns, showcasing my commitment to creating impactful, user-centered technologies.</p>

                    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                    <p>The team studied multiple case studies of water contamination in the United States over the past fifty years. It was apparent that the community in need is usually <span>very dependent on agencies to update them about their water quality and the state of emergency. The people do not have the power to understand their own water quality, and have been given misinformation countless times.</span><br><br>
                        Moving forward, the project focused on <span>Ashland, MA</span> as this was a direct instance of water contamination by the textile industry that resulted in harm to the local community. It was also conveniently close to Harvard, allowing us to travel to the site.<br><br>
                        Between 1965 and 1978, Nyanza Inc and other companies manufactured textile dyes, leading to large quantities of industrial waste and contamination of soil, ground water, and wetlands with mercury, chromium, arsenic, lead and more.
                        Effort to clean up the damage caused to the local water and other sources is still being conducted under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SuperFund program.<br><br>
                        Kevin, only 26 years old, had <span>died from one of the rare cancers</span> that locals were being diagnosed with.
                        It wasn’t until <span>after 8 years of begging for government involvement</span> that the EPA finally conducted a study that proved in the end that the Nyanza company had been the cause.

                    <p>From our research, it was clear we needed an affordable, reliable device to bring the power back to the people for their safety. We experimented with many forms and numerous chemical sensors.

We want people to know they have power and control over their water quality, but we did not want to make the object so noticable that they were constantly reminded of the threat. Our focus was a simple, discreet, futuristic aesthetic.
