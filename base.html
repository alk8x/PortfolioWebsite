                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>In Spring 2023, as part of my Masterâ€™s in Design Engineering at Harvard, I contributed to the creation of the BASE Water Sensor project, an initiative addressing water contamination from the textile industry. 
                    As a Mechanical Engineer and Storyteller, I led the design and narrative of DripTracker, one of three products we developed to provide real-time water quality data. 
                    My role involved utilizing CAD for product design, engaging in iterative development, and enhancing user experience through storytelling. 
                    This project demonstrated my capability to merge technical engineering with public engagement, culminating in solutions that are not only innovative but also respectful of environmental and public health concerns, showcasing my commitment to creating impactful, user-centered technologies.</p>

                    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p><span>About half of US water is too polluted</span> for swimming, fishing, or drinking. <br>
                    <span>The EPA has repeatedly lied</span> about water quality readings.<br>
                    <span>Textile effluent</span> contains heavy metals, which has polluted many of our waterways.<br>
